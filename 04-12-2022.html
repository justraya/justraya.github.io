                <p>Hi! <br><br> I started learning HTML/CSS back in the summer, but then stopped when 
                    university started. I picked it up again yesterday, with the intent to finally finish 
                    and publish my website. <br><br> I think it's working. <br><br> Oops, I forgot to 
                    include a place for an image description. Ironically, the image above is one of the 
                    mockups I made before putting my website together. I guess my planning skills need 
                    a little work. <br><br> I have a lot of different things I want to learn and I 
                    wanted a way to document my progress, hence this blog. Whenever I succeed at
                    something, I usually find it difficult to recall what it was like when I first 
                    started out, so this blog will help me remember. <br> <br> I had a blast making this 
                    site and there's a lot more that I want to learn when it comes to web development, 
                    but I'm going to shelve that topic for now because I have a new project in mind! 
                    <br><br> Stay tuned!
